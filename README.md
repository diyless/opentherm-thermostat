This repository is for a feedback on using our OpenTherm Thermostat.

Here you can request a new feature or report an issue(s) experienced while using our Thermostats.

## Original Firmware

If you have experimented with your thermostat, i.e. set up the wrong settings or loaded a custom firmware - you can restore the original one using our [web flasher](https://diyless.com/flasher).
You would not need an activation code if you use it with an original ESP32 bought from us in the thermostat bundle.
